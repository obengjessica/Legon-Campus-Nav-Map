# 🚀 UG Navigate – Optimal Routing Solution for University of Ghana Campus

![UG Navigate Banner](https://github.com/obengjessica/Legon-Campus-Nav-Map/blob/main/UG.jpeg)

> **UG Navigate** is a Java-based campus navigation system that helps users find the **best route** from one location to another on the University of Ghana campus — considering shortest distance, optimal arrival time, and real-time campus conditions.

---

## 📜 Project Overview

UG Navigate is designed to improve navigation efficiency on the University of Ghana (UG) campus.  
By combining **graph-based algorithms** and **route optimization techniques**, the application calculates and presents **optimal travel routes**, factoring in distances, traffic patterns, and landmarks.

Key features include:
- 🚗 **Shortest Distance Finder**
- ⏱ **Optimal Arrival Time Prediction**
- 🗺 **Landmark-based Route Suggestions**
- 📊 **Route Sorting & Comparison**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop an algorithm and a **Java desktop application** for campus route optimization.
- Use **multiple calculation methods** for distance and arrival time.
- Implement **sorting algorithms** for organized route results.
- Allow **landmark-based searching** for personalized navigation.
- Optimize performance with **Divide & Conquer**, **Greedy**, and **Dynamic Programming** techniques.

---

## ⚙️ Algorithms & Techniques Used

- **Vogel Approximation Method**
- **Northwest Corner Method**
- **Critical Path Method**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** – shortest path between nodes
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** – shortest paths between all pairs
- **A* Search Algorithm** – shortest path with heuristic cost
- **Quick Sort** / **Merge Sort** – route sorting
- Searching algorithms for **landmark-based route selection**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
- **Data Structures:** Graphs, Arrays, Lists
- **Algorithms:** Graph traversal, shortest path, sorting, searching
- **UI:** Java Swing (optional: JavaFX for modern UI)
